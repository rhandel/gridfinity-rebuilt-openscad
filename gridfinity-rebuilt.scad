 IMPORTANT: rendering will be better for analyzing the model if fast-csg is enabled. As of writing, this feature is only available in the development builds and not the official release of OpenSCAD, but it makes rendering only take a couple seconds, even for comically large bins. Enable it in Edit > Preferences > Features > fast-csg
 the plane that is the top of the internal bin solid is d_height+h_base above z=0
 the magnet holes can have an extra cut in them to make it easier to print without supports
 tabs will automatically be disabled when gridz is less than 3, as the tabs take up too much space
 base functions can be found in "gridfinity-rebuilt-base.scad"
 examples at end of file

 BIN HEIGHT
 the original gridfinity bins had the overall height defined by 7mm increments
 a bin would be 7*u millimeters tall
 the lip at the top of the bin (3.8mm) added onto this height
 The stock bins have unit heights of 2, 3, and 6:
 Z unit 2 -> 7*2 + 3.8 -> 17.8mm
 Z unit 3 -> 7*3 + 3.8 -> 24.8mm
 Z unit 6 -> 7*6 + 3.8 -> 45.8mm

// Compartments can be placed anywhere (this includes non-integer positions like 1/2 or 1/3). The grid is defined as (0,0) being the bottom left corner of the bin, with each unit being 1 base long. Each cut() module is a compartment, with the first four values defining the area that should be made into a compartment (X coord, Y coord, width, and height). These values should all be positive. t is the tab style of the compartment (0:full, 1:auto, 2:left, 3:center, 4:right, 5:none). s is a toggle for the bottom scoop.
